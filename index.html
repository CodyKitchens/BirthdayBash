            Greetings, Brave Souls,
        </p>
        <p>
            As I prepare to bid a fiery farewell to my roaring 30s, I invite you to join me for a day of intrigue and a night of remembrance. Our adventure begins with a daring <strong>Mafia-style water gun battle</strong>, where alliances are tested and only the cunning will survive. As dusk falls, gather around as we ignite the night with a <strong>Viking funeral</strong> to honor the decade past.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ship sets sail at [Location], on [Date]. Daytime skirmishes commence at 12:00 PM, leading to evening rites and revelries starting at sunset.
        </p>
        <p>
            Come clad in your best Viking or funeral attire to partake in the ceremonies, share a roast or eulogy in good spirits, and laugh at the memories we've forged. After we pay our respects, the night will conclude with cigars, camaraderie, and a poker tournament under the stars.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> The evenings celebration is for adults only. Let us relive the glory days and send off the 30s with a proper Viking goodbye, unburdened by the watchful eyes of the young.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your presence is both an honor and a boon. Please RSVP by [RSVP Deadline] to secure your place in the shield wall or at the poker table.
